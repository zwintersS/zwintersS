- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zechariah Winters
- I'm studying software development at IvyTech. If everything goes according to plan, I'll get my software development certificate in May 2025. From there, I plan on getting a job in the field and working towards an associate's degree in software development. I'm learning C++ and actively developing a game in my spare time.
